This dish is easy to make, and you can have it on the table in just under 30 minutes. The recipe calls for only a few simple ingredients, and it's a great way to use up any leftover rice you may have. The key to making a good paella is to use a wide, shallow pan to ensure that the rice cooks evenly and develops that all-important crust on the bottom.
