**T﻿ime:** 15 minutes\
**S﻿erves:** 2\
**C﻿alories:** 592

## **I﻿ngredients:**

* 1 pound dried pasta (such as spaghetti or penne)
* 2 cups fresh basil leaves
* 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup pine nuts
* 3 garlic cloves, peeled
* 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## **S﻿teps:**

1. Cook the pasta according to the package directions until al dente. Drain the pasta and reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water.
2. Meanwhile, in a food processor, combine the basil, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and garlic. Pulse until the mixture is finely chopped.
3. With the food processor running, slowly add the olive oil until the mixture forms a smooth paste. If the mixture is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water to thin it out.
4. Season the pesto with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Toss the cooked pasta with the pesto until it's evenly coated. If the pasta is too dry, add a little more of the reserved pasta water to moisten it.
6. Serve the pesto pasta immediately, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese and a few basil leaves if desired.
