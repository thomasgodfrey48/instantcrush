**T﻿ime:** 18 minutes\

**C﻿alories:** 473

Ingredients:

* 9 ounces ramen noodles
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 2 teaspoons sriracha, optional (add more or less to taste depending on how spicy you like things)
* 1 small clove garlic, minced (about ½ teaspoon total)
* 85 g teaspoon minced fresh ginger
* 85 g cup thinly sliced green onions
* 85 g cup chopped salted peanuts
* 4 teaspoons sesame seeds

**S﻿teps:**

Cook the noodles in boiling water for the time indicated on the package directions (usually this is 3 minutes); drain. While you are waiting for the noodle water to boil and for the noodles to cook, make the sauce by whisking together the soy sauce, peanut butter, vegetable oil, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, honey, sriracha, garlic, and ginger in a large bowl until smooth.

Add the cooked and drained noodles to the bowl with the sauce; toss until well-combined and all of the noodles are coated with sauce. Top with the green onions, peanuts, and sesame seeds.

Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold (if you want to serve them cold, hold off on the toppings, put them in the fridge for an hour or two until they are chilled, and add the toppings when you serve them).
