**Ingredients:**

* 1 pound pie crust
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/2 cup dry white wine
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1/4 teaspoon dried basil
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
* 1/2 pound sea scallops
* 1/2 pound lump crabmeat, picked over for shells

**Steps:**

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Roll out your pie crust and use it to line a 9-inch pie dish. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork and bake it for 10-12 minutes, or until it's just starting to turn golden brown. Set the crust aside to cool.
3. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the white wine to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Let it cook for a few minutes until it's reduced by about half.
5. In a small bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, flour, thyme, basil, oregano, and black pepper. Add this mixture to the skillet and stir until it's well combined with the wine mixture.
6. Add the shrimp and scallops to the skillet and stir to coat them with the sauce. Let them cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they're just starting to turn opaque.
7. Add the crabmeat to the skillet and gently fold it in with the other seafood.
8. Pour the seafood mixture into the prepared pie crust and smooth it out into an even layer.
9. Bake the pie for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is hot and bubbly.
10. Let the pie cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
